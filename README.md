# Spotify to YouTube
* addArtistDiscography.py, addLargePlaylist.py, and addSmallPlaylist.py lets the user enter in a Spotify playlist and their YouTube playlist. The programs will then search every song specified in the Spotify playlist on YouTube and add those songs to the user's YouTube playlist.
* addArtistDiscography.py lets the user specify which Artist on Spotify they would like to download the entire discography for and have as a playlist to listen to under their YouTube account.
* addLargePlaylist.py lets the user specify which Spotify playlist they would like to have transferred to their YouTube playlist. Users should use this program if they are wanting to transfer Spotify playlists with over 50 songs.
* addSmallPlaylist.py has the same functionality as the addLargePlaylist.py program, but is optimized for smaller Spotify playlists of 50 or less songs.
* createNewPlaylist.py allows the user to automatically create a new playlist on YouTube so that the newly created playlist can be used with the above programs.
